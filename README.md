Philip Rettig, Yohan Pellerin, Romain Darous.

### DT2112
DT2112 is the course of "Speech Technology" of KTH. This repository contains the final project of this course.

### The project
The data provided was videos of human beings performing signs of the Swedish sign language. The goal of the project was to evaluate whether using pose extraction as a feature extraction technique would allow to improve sign classification on videos.
For the project, we implemented recurrent neural networks made of several layers of LSTM units to perform the classification task. The full report is uploaded in the repositiry.
